## Hi there üëã

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm Tinotenda Dauti, a versatile Software Engineer with a strong passion for web development, especially in building intuitive and user-centric applications. I specialize in Frontend Development using modern frameworks like ReactJS, Next.js, and VueJS, and I‚Äôve worked extensively with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux. Having recently completed my Software Development Professional Certificate at CodeSpace Academy, I‚Äôve equipped myself with industry-standard skills to deliver high-quality software solutions.

My development approach is centered on writing clean, maintainable code and solving complex problems efficiently. Whether I‚Äôm designing seamless user interfaces or optimizing the performance of a web application, I strive to create scalable, impactful solutions. I‚Äôm always open to learning new technologies and improving my craft, making adaptability one of my core strengths.

üîß Secondary Expertise
Alongside my primary focus on web development, I‚Äôm expanding my knowledge in blockchain development, working with chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Near, and using technologies such as Solidity and Rust. I also have experience building mobile applications using Flutter and React Native, which I am actively working to improve, further diversifying my skill set.

üìö Outside of Tech
I‚Äôm deeply passionate about business and enjoy staying active through calisthenics, football, and golf. When I‚Äôm not working on tech projects, I‚Äôm traveling and immersing myself in different cultures. My favorite travel destinations so far include Ghana, Kenya, and Cape Town.

‚ö° Fun Fact
I love tackling new challenges, whether it‚Äôs learning a new framework or taking on a new hobby, there is always something new to explore!
